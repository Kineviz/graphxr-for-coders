[GraphXR](GraphXR/What%20is%20GraphXR?.md) provides a coder friendly API, called [GraphXR API](GraphXR%20For%20Coders/graphxr-api/GraphXR%20API) which makes it easier to work with data, layouts, transforms, and algorithms. GraphXR bundles [Grove](GraphXR%20For%20Coders/Grove/Grove), a JavaScript playground suitable for rapidly developing custom applications with GraphXR and GraphXR API.
